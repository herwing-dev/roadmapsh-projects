The goal of this project is to teach you about positioning and layout in CSS. Below is a rough mockup showing some testimonial cards. Each card is designed to help you understand different layout and positioning techniques.

Feel free to use any content and images you like for the testimonials.

After completing this project, you will have a good understanding of how to create layouts using HTML and CSS. You can further enhance your skills by exploring more complex projects as you progress.
