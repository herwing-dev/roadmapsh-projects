# Styled HTML Website Project

## Goal
The goal of this project is to teach you how to style a website using CSS. You will take the structure from the previous HTML-only project and apply various CSS techniques to enhance its appearance and responsiveness.

## Project Overview
In this project, you will style the HTML website structure you created previously in a different project. The focus will be on learning how to use CSS to:

- Create responsive layouts
- Apply color and typography
- Enhance the overall design of your website

Rough mockups of the website structure for mobile and desktop devices are provided below. Do not worry about the design details (i.e., colors, backgrounds, etc.) at this stage. We are not looking for a beautiful design but a well-structured and responsive website. Just focus on making the layout match the mockup and ensuring it looks good on different screen sizes.

- Consistent use of a chosen color scheme and typography
- Proper use of CSS techniques like Flexbox, media queries, and the box model

## Bonus Points
For bonus points, you can:

- Use Google Fonts to enhance the typography of your website
- Host your website for free using GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages
- Add support for dark mode using CSS variables

## Next Steps
After completing this project, you will have a solid understanding of how to style a basic HTML website using CSS. You can move on to more advanced topics, such as CSS animations, transitions, and grid layouts, in future projects.
